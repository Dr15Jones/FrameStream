<H1>The HeteroContainer Package</H1>

<P>The HeteroContainer Package provides the utilities for the construction
of type safe heterogenious containers.</P>

<H2>Requirements.</H2>

<P>When one first thinks about how an Event object should be written, one
usually thinks of adding accessor functions for each of the types of data
that an Event should have. But over time, those accessors could change and
each change would force people to recompile their code. In addition, people
may want to add their own information to an Event. This could be done through
inheritance (e.g. MyEvent inheriting from Event) but if you are handed an
Event, how would you know if it actually a MyEvent? These problems can be
overcome if one can use a type-safe heterogenious container.</P>

<P>When retrieving data from a heterogenious container, knowing just the
'Type' (i.e. class) of the data to be retrieved is not enough since we might
want to store multiple instances of a 'Type' in the container. E.g. we might
want a list of 'good' and a list of 'bad' Tracks. Therefore in addition
to the 'Type' of the data, we also need to specify 'Usage'. But that still
is not sufficient. Since we want to allow multiple algorithms to create
the same data, we also need to specify how the data was produced.</P>

<P>The actual class stored in the container may be different than 'Type'.
In the Record we don't actually store Tracks, instead we store Proxy&lt;
Track &gt;.</P>

<P>It would also be very useful to be able to get a listing of all the items
held by the container. This listing should be able to generate human readable
information.</P>

<P>With the above use case in mind, we find that a heterogeneous container
must have the following properties:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>be able to 'insert' and 'find' objects in a typesafe manner
  <LI>allow an addtional Tag to distinguish between different objects of
  the same type. The actually implementation of the Tag should be customizable
  to the exact problem being solved.
  <LI>allow the ItemType to be different (but related to) Type.
  <LI>provide a human readable list of the container's contents.
</UL>

<H2>Design.</H2>

<P>In order to find an item within the container we need to know its associated
Type and its Tag. Since these always appear together, it makes sense to
group the Type and Tag into a Key. To simplify the mental model we will
refer to Type by a TypeTag and therefore a Key holds two tags, a TypeTag
and an IdTag. Since the IdTag can be specialized it means the Key can also
be specialized.</P>

<P>Different problems will want to use different heterogeneous containters
with different storage strategies: e.g. one might want to optimize size
over speed while another problem needs speed over size. This implies that
we should allow the user to specialize the storage strategy used by the
HeteroContainer.</P>

<P>Type-safety for the heterogeneous container can be achieved through the
use of templates. The best way would be to use templated member functions
on the HeteroContainer class. Unfortunately not all of our compilers can
handle templated member functions, therefore we will need to use templated
helper classes.</P>

<P>The HeteroContainer is specified by three template arguments:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Storage: a homogeneous container which can hold a pointer to the base
  class of all the different items (or a void*). The Storage class must be
  able to retrieve an item using the Key
  <LI>Key: the specific lookup key
  <LI>IdTag: the specific IdTag
</UL>

<P>To allow typesafe access to the items within the Container, the helper
class takes two additional template argument:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>ItemType: it is the class type of the item being inserted/found
  <LI>Type: use to build the TypeTag. ItemType should somehow be derivable
  from Type, e.g. ItemType is actually a templated class that uses Type as
  one of its template parameters.
</UL>

<H3>concepts</H3>

<P>To summarize the concepts used in the design</P>

<DL>
  <DT>Key
  <DD>object used to identify an item within the container. The Key holds
  a TypeTag and an IdTag.
  <DT>TypeTag
  <DD>used to identify the class Type of an item.
  <DT>IdTag
  <DD>used to distinguish between two items of the same Type.
  <DD>&nbsp;
</DL>

<H3>classes</H3>

<P>The following are brief descriptions of the classes that make up the
design of the HeteroContainer facility. The classes that makeup the design
are shown in the accompanying class diagram.</P>

<DL>
  <DT><B>HCTypeTag&lt; <I>Group</I> &gt;</B>
  <DD>holds the unsigned int used to identify a type and has a pointer to
  the class types name (NOTE: TypeTag holds onto the const char* and will
  not delete it). The static function nextValue() is used by inheriting classes
  to assign a unique number to a type. The template parameter Group is used
  to allow different instances of HCTypeTag&lt;&gt; to not have to use the
  same type to integer conversion.
  <DL>
    <DT><B>HCTypeTagTemplate&lt;<I>Type, Group</I>&gt;</B>
    <DD>Its constructor sets the unsigned int and const char* needed by TypeTag.
    The static method classValue() holds the unsigned int that corresponds
    to Type. The static method className() returns the name of the class Type.
  </DL>
  <DT><B>HCMethods&lt; <I>Type, ItemType, Storage, Key, IdTag</I> &gt;</B>
  <DL>
    <DT>This class holds the templated member methods we would have if compilers
    supported templated member methods. The static methods are
  </DL>
  <UL>
    <LI><TT>Key makeKey( const IdTag&amp; )</TT> : constructs a Key from an
    IdTag and the Type.
    <LI><TT>bool insert( Storage&amp;, ItemType*, const IdTag&amp; )</TT> :
    inserts an item of type into the container . This function uses makeKey(...).
    False is returned if an item of that Type and same IdTag is already in
    the container.
    <LI><TT>ItemType* find( Storage&amp;, const IdTag&amp; )</TT> : finds an
    item of type Type with IdTag. Returns 0 if no item was found.
  </UL>
  <DD>The methods needed by each of the template parameter classes are
  <DL>
    <DT><B><I>Type</I></B>
    <DD>Type should somehow be related to ItemType
    <DT><B><I>ItemType</I></B>
    <DD>ItemType* must have implicit conversion to what ever type the Storage
    class can hold.
    <DT><B><I>Storage</I></B>
    <DD>This is a container which holds items of type base class for ItemType*
    (we will call this base class ItemBase) and has the following methods
    <UL>
      <LI><TT>bool insert( const Key&amp;, ItemBase* )</TT>
      <LI><TT>ItemBase* find( const Key&amp; )</TT>
    </UL>
    <DT><B><I>Key</I></B>
    <DD>must have the following methods
    <UL>
      <LI><TT>Key( const TypeTag&lt;Key&gt;&amp;, const IdTag&amp; )</TT>
      <LI><TT>Key( const Key&amp; )</TT>
      <LI><TT>Key&amp; operator=( const Key&amp; )</TT>
      <LI><TT>const TypeTag&lt; Key &gt;&amp; typeTag() const</TT>
    </UL>
    <DD>plus any comparison methods needed by Storage.
    <DT><B><I>IdTag</I></B>
    <DD>must have the following methods
    <UL>
      <LI><TT>IdTag( const IdTag&amp; )</TT>
      <LI><TT>IdTag&amp; operator=( const IdTag&amp; )</TT>
    </UL>
    <DD>plus any comparison methods needed by Key.
  </DL>
  <DT>&nbsp;
</DL>

<H2>Use Example</H2>

<P>To understand the implication of this design, we can quickly show how
this would work with Record. The main idea would be to create a helper class
called RecordMethods which specializes HCMethods for use with a Record.
This class is simply</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>template&lt; class T &gt;</TT></P>
  <P><TT>class RecordMethods : public HCMethods&lt; T, Proxy&lt;T&gt;, Record,
  DataKey, DataTags &gt; {</TT></P>
  <P><TT>private:</TT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><TT>RecordMethods();</TT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>};</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>then to insert a proxy into a Record you just say</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>//set up the variables</TT></P>
  <P><TT>Proxy&lt; Foo &gt;* myProxy;</TT></P>
  <P><TT>...</TT></P>
  <P><TT>RecordMethods&lt;Foo&gt;::insert( iRecord, myProxy, myTags);</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>to retrieve from a Record is also simple</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>Proxy&lt;Foo&gt;* myProxy = RecordMethods&lt;Foo&gt;::find( iRecord,
  myTags );</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These templates can also be used by FortranInterfacer within its FIExtractorDictionary
class. The FIExtractorDictionary could use the helper class FIEDMethods
which is initialized as</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><TT>template&lt; class T&gt;</TT></P>
  <P><TT>class FIEDMethods :: public HCMethods&lt; T, T, HCMapStorage&lt;_fortraninterfacer_map_&gt;,
  FIKey, string &gt;</TT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where HCMapStorage&lt;...&gt; is an adapter to allow you to easily use
an STL map as your storage method.</P>
